# Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy

The Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy is a simple programming exercise that's often used to screen candidates for software developer positions. I decided to work the exercise as if I were on a team developing microservices. 

Many people have worked the exercise and posted their code online, along with copies of the problem description. I copiecd one of the problem descriptions to this project so we would have a reference that won't disappear (unless this project disappears, as well). See ![Problem Description](https://github.com/neopragma/ruby-galaxy/raw/master/ProblemDescription.md).
